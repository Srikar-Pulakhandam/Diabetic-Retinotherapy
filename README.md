# Diabetic-Retinotherapy
Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye condition that can lead to blindness if not detected and treated early. This project aims to develop a computer-based system for the detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal images. The project includes the following key components:

Image data collection and preparation.
Machine learning model development for retinopathy detection.
User interface for image input and result display.
The goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, thereby improving patient outcomes and preventing vision loss.
